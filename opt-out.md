# Opt-Out

- The part that feels overwelming is having to write something in python and tests. I've only used the Jython in the first semester of CS. The research I would need to do combined with using A.I. would take me hours to do in order to make something good enough
when I could just opt-out. Then tests. I made tests in the third semester with test driven development, but it's been so long I have forgotton how to actually write tests. Then there's just my general coding being behind. Besides your class I don't think I've made an actual coding project that wasn't simple web development in over a year. Maybe two.
