# About Me

**What programming languages have you used?**
- Java, HTML, and a little typescript

**Did you code mostly in classes, internships, real jobs, or personal projects? Put example projects and what did you do.**
- I've only actually coded in about 4 classes where it was a focus. Then like 2 where it was there, but mostly theory.

**What was the largest program/system youâ€™ve worked on?**
- Vote Vault. You already know all about Vote Vault with Duncan.

**What do you feel most comfortable doing in code?**
- I don't feel comfortable at all. I've only done what was required in classes and somehow managed to avoid any classes where it was the main focus and got really far behind.

**What do you feel least comfortable doing?What programming languages have you used?**
- I'm not comfortable with languages and things that haven't been taught in a class. I don't have the technical knowledge to transform what I know into something different.
